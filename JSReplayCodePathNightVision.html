  JS Replay Code Path Night Vision<br><br>
  I dislike fishing for logic bugs and binary searches and commenting out code<br>
  are too time consuming. I decided to let the computer help me find out where<br>
  the flow of control logic and boolean logic are going wrong.<br><br>
  This will be a .js file when completed and be open source.<br><br>
  The main reason for this tool is to write working code faster, must faster,<br>
  by reducing debugging time by pinpointing where the program is doing<br>
  something wrong (that we as humans can see but the computer isn't aware of it)<br>
  and thereby we know where to focus our concentration on the bad logic, and most<br>
  especially to *instantly* see (and know) what functions fired and which didn't.<br><br>

  The point of creating this JS Debugging Tool is to save debugging hours of <br>
  time per day by learning the truth of what the code logic is really doing <br>
  as opposed to not meshing with what we thought(or assumed) that the code <br>
  is [probably] doing. [what we hope it should have done]<br><br>
  Essentially I wanted to lift the veil, clear the fog, and know where the program<br>
  logic is going wrong *visually* and *instantly* by seeing the flow path while<br>
  at the same time being able to *instantly* see the actual path the code ran.<br><br>
The purpose of JS Replay Code Path (Night Vision) is to see what the machine sees in<br>
terms of variables values and what the logic told it to do. Trace of functions and<br>
the flow of control that the computer took running the code. This will allow<br>
stepping through each function and knowing the exact path that the computer took<br>
to discover where the logic is wrong. The short description is this tool should<br>
help find logic bugs faster by visually stepping through code through a map<br>
view diagram top down to better understand where the code is going wrong to save<br>
 vast precious time.<br>
<br>
 I will build this over the next few months.<br>
<br>
The main premise is a plumbing analogy of pipes in someone's house and seeing<br>
what the course flow of control path through the program that the code executed<br>
to verify with empirical evidence what the code actually did.<br>
<br>
 I dreamed up this idea a year ago and just recently figured out how to make it<br>
 work.<br>
<br>
Another benefit will be Unit Tester to get info on a function under development<br>
to step through what the code did and see the inputs and outputs based on<br>
what actually happened.<br>
<br>
I recently got overly annoyed by using alerts and found console.log too disorganized<br>
to see the truth of what the code was doing. I have visualized a top down flow chart<br>
of each function in terms of fluid dynamics and I want to see the course that the<br>
code is executing so I can discover logic bugs faster and make sure that the<br>
necessary functions are firing(being called) and so I will know what the code<br>
actually did - so that I can see the truth and pinpoint where the code (boolean logic)<br>
is wrong. The machine only does what it's told to do (in the code) and to error<br>
is human but since bugs are a given I wanted to be able to find out what the code<br>
is doing to learn faster if the code is obeying what the design specifies it should do.<br>
<br>
At the same time going through code constantly switching back and forth<br>
in one's mind between English and JavaScript can get taxing so in Replay mode<br>
the literate programming viewpoint (which the user inputs) will help follow<br>
what is supposed to happen and what the code is supposed to be doing. And even<br>
more importantly the pseudocode (typed in by the user) is necessary to see<br>
next to each function so that the human can spot the logic bug and compare in<br>
their mind the "design logic" in pseueocode with the source code in the function.<br>
<br>
Again the literate description what the code is supposed to do explained to another<br>
human and the pseudocode are completley optional and the programmer will write<br>
it in (if they so choose) and then this becomes a more effective tool in terms<br>
of documentation which Brooks always preached because code is so hard to decypher -<br>
Especially someone else's uncommented code.<br>
<br>
I decided to design and build this application (under development) so that I<br>
can debug faster by discovering what the code actually did rather than what<br>
I think it did when it ran.<br>
<br>
This applicaton will gather the data from each pass of running through a JS program<br>
and then in Replay mode using this information it will show a map of the flow of<br>
control that actually happened with a trace of each function with inputs and<br>
outputs to see what the machine saw. It will also show all assertions.<br>
<br><br>

Going top down through the flow of control based on what actually<br>
happened at each function is called when the code was running will help<br>
understand any wrong turns. The other feature that I will add is the logic view.<br>
What is supposed to happen at a certain point and what actually happened.<br>
<br>
Most importantly this debugging tool will provide a view of<br>
exactly what the machine sees and if the code is doing what it's supposed to do.<br>

<br><br>
Seeing logic calculations and variable values and<br>
the results of conditionals should provide a window inside<br>
the working program - after it has run to gain crucial information<br>
regarding where things go bad or rather where the design needs fixing.<br>
<br>
Debugging is figuring out what the code actually did<br>
as opposed to doing what it was designed to do.<br>
<br>
My truthism is first look at the designed logic and then look at what the <br>
code did (progrmamed boolean logic)(to see if the two logics agree).<br>
<br>
I came up with this idea a year ago walking through a forest in Oregon<br>
and I figured out how to impliment it recently.<br>
<br>
There will be an interactive flow of control map<br>
on the web page and after a program runs it will<br>
visually show the course path that the code took<br>
and the order of functions and inputs and outputs<br>
and the values of the assertions.<br>

The programmer will be able step through the Replay View<br>
step by step (with a click) (this is after the code ran; not during). So this<br>
a residue shadow of information of what actually happened.<br>
This is so it's possible to pause anytime. Because in reality <br>
while using Replay mode the user is just traversing through<br>
the information produced from the trace path and var values<br>
<br>
I got sick and tired of using alerts and the console.log()<br>
doesn't do justice to what information I need from<br>
my code when it's running.<br>
<br>
I came up with the idea of Slow Motion Replay<br>
(rather than stopping at break points) so that<br>
I can control the flow through the information gleaned<br>
from the running of a JS program.<br>
<br>
By knowing the path that the code took for certain inputs<br>
and seeing the functions called and seeing the<br>
inputs and outputs for each function it will be much<br>
easier to pinpoint where the bugs are.<br>
<br>
At the same time rather than seeing the code what<br>
will be shown is the litereate level programming<br>
description and What is supposed to happen<br>
and how something works.<br>
<br>
The user will click to determine the speed that<br>
they traverse through the program reviewing what<br>
happened at each point as they follow the flow of<br>
control through the boolean logic and what happened<br>
inside of each function.<br>
<br>
I will make it possible to copy and paste the source code<br>
for each function so it can be seen side by side with <br>
what the pseudocode/litereate mode show. And to pinpoint<br>
where the source code and design description don't mesh.<br>

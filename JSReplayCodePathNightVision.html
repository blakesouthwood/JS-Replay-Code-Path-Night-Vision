  JS Replay Code Path Night Vision<br>
The purpose of JS Replay Code Path (Night Vision) is to see what the machine sees in
terms of variables values and what the logic told it to do. Trace of functions and
the flow of control that the computer took running the code. This will allow
stepping through each function and knowing the exact path that the computer took
to discover where the logic is wrong. The short description is this tool should
help find logic bugs faster by visually steppping through code through a map
view diagram top down to better understand wherethe code is going wrong to save
 vast precious time.

 I will build this over the next few months.

The main premise is a plumbing analogy of pipes in someone's house and seeing
what the course flow of control path through the program that the code executed
to verify with empirical evidence what the code actually did.

 I dreamed up this idea a year ago and just recently figured out how to make it
 work.

Another benefit will be Unit Tester to get info on a function under development
to step through what the code did and see the inputs and outputs based on
what actually happened.

I recently got overly annoyed by using alerts and found console.log too disorganized
to see the truth of what the code was doing. I have visualized a top down flow chart
of each function in terms of fluid dynamics and I want to see the course that the
code is executing so I can discover logic bugs faster and make sure that the
necessary functions are firing(being called) and so I will know what the code
actually did - so that I can see the truth and pinpoint where the code (boolean logic)
is wrong. The machine only does what it's told to do (in the code) and to error
is human but since bugs are a given I wanted to be able to find out what the code
is doing to learn faster if the code is obeying what the design specifies it should do.

At the same time going through code constantly switching back and forth
in one's mind between English and JavaScript can get taxing so in Replay mode
the literate programming viewpoint (which the user inputs) will help follow
what is supposed to happen and what the code is supposed to be doing. And even
more importantly the pseudocode (typed in by the user) is necessary to see
next to each function so that the human can spot the logic bug and compare in
their mind the "design logic" in pseueocode with the source code in the function.

Again the literate description what the code is supposed to do explained to another
human and the pseudocode are completley optional and the programmer will write
it in (if they so choose) and then this becomes a more effective tool in terms
of documentation which Brooks always preached because code is so hard to decypher.
Especially someone else's uncommented code.

I decided to design and build this application (under development) so that I
can debug faster by discovering what the code actually did rather than what
I think it did when it ran.

This applicaton will gather the data from each pass of running through a JS program
and then in Replay mode using this information it will show a map of the flow of
control that actually happened with a trace of each function with inputs and
outputs to see what the machine saw. It will also show all assertions.


Going top down through the flow of control based on what actually
happened at each function is called when the code was running will help
understand any wrong turns. The other feature that I will add is the logic view.
What is supposed to happen at a certain point and what actually happened.

Most importantly this debugging tool will provide a view of
exactly what the machine sees and if the code is doing what it's supposed to do.


Seeing logic calculations and variable values and
the results of conditionals should provide a window inside
the working program - after it has run to gain crucial information
regarding where things go bad or rather where the design needs fixing.

Debugging is figuring out what the code actually did
as opposed to doing what it was designed to do.

I came with an idea a year ago that I figured out
how to impliment recently.

There will be an interactive flow of control map
on the web page and after a program runs it will
visually show the course path that the code took
and the order of functions and inputs and outputs
and the values of the assertions.

I got sick and tired of using alerts and the console.log()
doesn't do justice to what information I need from
my code when it's running.

I came up with the idea of Slow Motion Replay
(rather than stopping at break points) so that
I can control the flow through the information gleaned
from the running of a JS program.

By knowing the path that the code took for certain inputs
and seeing the functions called and seeing the
inputs and outputs for each function it will be much
easier to pinpoint where the bugs are.

At the same time rather than seeing the code what
will be shown is the litereate level programming
description and What is supposed to happen
and how something works.

The user will click to determine the speed that
they traverse through the program reviewing what
happened at each point as they follow the flow of
control through the boolean logic and what happened
inside of each function.

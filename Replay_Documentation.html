  The beginning of Replay started back in 2017 in Florida.<br>
  I made a reverse dictionary and started on the debug view.<br>
  I integrated them together in a rush.<br><br>
  But I lost interest because it didn't provide the valuable info<br>
  that I needed immediately accessible such as what the code was<br>
  supposed to do at each point and what should happen and what<br>
  shouldn't happen.<br><br>
  I wanted to see trace feedback of functions called in the web<br>
  page as I used the code rather than in the console.log and without<br>
  annoying alerts and then I wanted to see var values. But I realize<br>
  now that it's important to see (where) I am in the code while it's <br>
  running so I'm going to add that with a map view with levels.<br>
<br><br>
  I built the reverse dictionary in 2017 as a prototype to <br>
see what I could do and after 2 years got the ideas <br>
to improve it so that it provided more information. <br>
<br><br>
I was testing my debugging visual tool by adding it <br>
to the reverse dictionary. <br>
<br><br>
the initial debugging aid showed thet trace growing function<br>
list but it revealed where improvements could be made with<br>
more information and the idea of understanding more about<br>
what the code's flow of control route is *after* it runs <br>
to be a true debugging tool for humans.<br>
 <br><br>
 As Brooks always said, First Throw One Away, meaning that<br>
 the first attempt is based on wrong assumptions. But at the<br>
 same time the first experience making a debugging tool revealed<br>
 most importantly that I needed more information - visually -<br>
 to see the path visually and the true course that the code took<br>
 along with assertions and the values at each point clickable<br>
 on the screen that the machine saw.<br>
<br><br>



I will start coding the Replay program this week.
